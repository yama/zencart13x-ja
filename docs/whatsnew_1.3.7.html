<h1>IMPORTANT NOTES </h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="style1">SECURITY:</span><span class="error"> Please be sure to review and apply the <a href="./important_site_security_recommendations.html" target="_blank">Site Security Recommendations</a> to your site prior to taking your shop &quot;live&quot;.</span> If you are uncertain about how site security applies to you, talk to your web host to ensure that you have proper measures in place. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><span class="emphasize">NEW <strong class="style1">PayPal Express Checkout</strong> module added. This allows you to use the PayPal Express Checkout option for your customers' shopping convenience.<br>
  You do NOT need a Website Payments Pro account in order to use this module.<br>
  Support for Website Payments Pro features (such as DirectPayment) will be added in a future release.<br>
  All you need in order to use this module is your API credentials from your PayPal &quot;business&quot; or &quot;premier&quot; account, which are available under your PayPal &quot;Profile&quot; tab on the PayPal website. <br>
  See further module details below. </span><br>
  <br>

</li>
  <li><span class="style1 error">PayPal IPN Users:</span> <span class="error">If you are using the <strong>PayPal IPN</strong> payment module, you will need to Remove and re-Install the PayPal module in Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Payment-&gt;PayPal in order to take advantage of the bugfixes in the module.</span> (Write down your settings first, for easier re-configuration!) <br>
  <br>
</li>
  <li><span class="style1">Authorizenet AIM Users:</span> <span class="error">A change was made to this module to allow easier logging of problems via a debug mode. If you are using the <strong>Authorizenet AIM</strong> payment module, you will need to Remove and re-Install the module in Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Payment in order to make this work properly.</span> (Write down your settings first, for easier re-configuration!) <br>

  <br>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>UPGRADING YOUR TEMPLATES </h1>
Since version 1.2, Zen Cart&trade; has had a major overhaul of the templating system for v1.3.  As such, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>
upgrade your existing template by applying the new stylesheet and moving a few lines of code around; or</li>
<li><strong>the best way </strong>to have almost-tableless and much tidier template code, is to <strong>make a new template</strong> (based on template_default or the new &quot;green&quot; classic introduced in v1.3.5) and carefully re-apply your own customizations to the new template system.</li>
</ul>


<p>For further information on template upgrading, see the support-forum discussion on this topic. </p>


<h1>CHANGELOG - List of Changed Files </h1>
<p>For a list of files that have been changed since v1.3.6, see the <a href="changelog-v1-3-7.html" target="_blank">changelog-v1-3-7.html</a> </p>
<h1>Whats New ... </h1>
<h3><strong>The following Improvements and bugfixes are included in v1.3.7: </strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="error"><strong>SECURITY UPDATES. There are two important security updates related to XSS vulnerabilities included in this release. <strong class="style1 error">YOU SHOULD PREPARE TO UPGRADE ASAP</strong></strong><br>

    for Express Checkout </span>(for US merchant accounts)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li class="emphasize"><strong class="style1">PayPal Express Checkout</strong> payment module added 
<br>
    <br>
    NOTE: This module does NOT require or use Website Payments Pro. WPP will come in a future release.<br> 
    <br>
  Some of the features include: <ul>
    <li>NO LONGER RELIES ON IPN POST-BACKS TO RELEASE ORDERS 
    <li><strong>Requires CURL </strong>for operation, and supports CURL by Proxy if required
    by hosting server <li>Customers can initiate Express Checkout directly from the Shopping-Cart page       or from the Login page (if they have something in their shopping cart already) 
    <li>Depending on configuration settings, checkout could be done in two clicks at your site (apart from processing login and address selection on the PayPal site).     <br>- can auto-select &quot;cheapest&quot;-available shipping method for the customer<br>- can skip the payment-selection page if no coupons or gift certificates are active<br>- customer can jump directly from PayPal page to confirmation page to complete an order 
    <li>PayPal can still be selected from the regular payments page as a regular option instead of Express Checkout if the customer prefers or requires such an approach. 
    <li>PayPal invoices can now include detailed line-item transaction information (as long as no discounts were applied to the order)     
    <li>Merchant can now &quot;require&quot; that the customer supply a PayPal-&quot;confirmed&quot; address     
    <li>If an account doesn't already exist for the customer using express-checkout, it is auto-created for them. If the customer purchases downloads or gift certificates, their password is emailed to them along with the create-account welcome message. This can be always-on by default if the module's settings are configured as such. 
    <li>Supports all 17 currencies supported by PayPal     
    <li>Refund all or part of an order directly from Admin     
    <li>PayPal page-style support built-in     
    <li>Still uses IPN functionality to update orders when status is changed in PayPal account, but orders will not be held 
    <li>Older PayPal IPN payment module can still be used, or can be turned off in lieu of this one     
  </ul>
<strong>Configuration instructions </strong>can be found here: <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/getpaypal/" target="_blank">PayPal Express Checkout Setup Instructions</a>  <br>
(NEEDS a PayPal API Username, Password, and Signature key, from your PayPal profile screens) <br>
<br>
<em>Future enhancements will include Website Payments Pro support. </em><br>
</li>
      <br>

  <li class="emphasize"><strong>Added</strong>: Logoff button added to Checkout_Success page </li>
  <span class="emphasize"><br>
</span>
  <li class="emphasize"><strong>Added</strong>:  Stylesheet: Added #indexHomeBody to identify the &quot;home&quot; page. This also means that a css file named
    &quot;home.css&quot; can now optionally be used to override just the home page.</li>
