<h1 align="center">STEPS IN SECURING YOUR ZEN CART&trade; STORE </h1>
<p>The following is a list of several steps you can take to secure your Zen Cart&trade; site:  </p>
<h1>1. Delete the /zc_install folder </h1>
<p>Once installation is complete, delete the <span class="filename">/zc_install</span> folder from the server. <br />
Don't simply rename the folder, as this leaves you vulnerable if someone were to discover this renamed folder.
</p>
<h1>2. Rename your &quot;/admin&quot; folder </h1>
<p>Renaming the &quot;admin&quot; folder makes it much harder for would-be hackers to get into your admin area. </p>
<p><em>(Before making the following changes, make sure to have a current backup of your files and your database.)</em></p>
<p>A- Open your <span class="filename">admin/includes/configure.php</span>, using a simple text editor like notepad. <br>
Change all instances of <span class="filename">/admin/</span> to your chosen new admin folder-name.</p>
<p>Change this section:</p>
<p class="filename">define('DIR_WS_ADMIN', '<span class="pseudolink">/admin/</span>');<br>
define('DIR_WS_CATALOG', '/');<br>
define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_ADMIN', '<span class="pseudolink">/admin/</span>');<br>
define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_CATALOG', '/');</p>
<p>And this section:</p>
<p><span class="filename">define('DIR_FS_ADMIN', '/home/mystore.com/www/public</span><span class="pseudolink">/admin/</span><span class="filename">');<br>
define('DIR_FS_CATALOG', '/home/mystore.com/www/public/');</span></p>
<p>B- Find your Zen Cart<span class="filename"> /admin/</span> directory, using your FTP software or your webhost File Manager.<br />
Rename the directory to match the settings you just made in your <span class="filename">admin/includes/configure.php</span>.</p>
<p>C - To login to your admin system you will now have to visit a new URL  that matches the new name used in steps A and B above. For example  instead of visiting <em>http://www.example.com/admin/</em> visit <em>http://www.example.com/NeW_NamE4u/</em>. </p>
<p>D - You should also protect your admin area by using a .htaccess file similar to the one shown below, and placing it into /admin/includes. (This should already exist in Zen Cart versions 1.2.7 and greater.) </p>
<h1>3. Set configure.php files read-only</h1>
<p>It's important that you CHMOD (set permissions) on the two configure.php files as read-only.<br />
Typically this means setting it to &quot;644&quot;, or in some cases &quot;444&quot;.</p>
<p> The configure.php files are located in:<br>
/&lt;YourStoresFolder&gt;/includes/configure.php<br>
/&lt;YourStoresFolder&gt;/admin/includes/configure.php </p>
<p>Quite often setting permissions on a file to read only via FTP  will not work. Even if the permission looks like it was set to read  only, it really may not have been. You must verify the correct setting  by entering the store and seeing if there is a warning message on the  top of the screen. "Warning: I am able to write to the configuration  file:..." In this case you will need to use the "File Manager" supplied  with your webhosting account. </p>
<p>If you're using a Windows server, simply set the file as <em>Read-Only</em> for <em>Everyone</em> and especially the <strong>IUSR_xxxxx (Internet Guest Account)</strong> user if running IIS, or the <em>System</em> account or <em>apache user</em> if running Apache. </p>
<h1>4. Delete any unused Admin accounts </h1>
<p><span class="filename">Admin-&gt;Tools-&gt;Admin Settings</span><br />
In your admin area, open the <strong>Tools </strong>menu, and choose <strong>Admin Settings</strong><br />
- Check for any unused admin accounts, and delete them. Especially the &quot;Demo&quot; account, if it exists.</p>
<h1>5. Admin Password Security </h1>
<p><strong>It is wise to use complicated passwords so that a would-be hacker cannot easily guess them.</strong><br />
<br />
<span class="error">You can change your admin password</span> in Admin-&gt;Tools-&gt;Admin Settings, and click on the &quot;<strong>Reset Password</strong>&quot; button, or click on the icon that looks like a recycle symbol. </p>
<p>We recommend that you use passwords that are at least 8 characters long.<br /> 
Making them alpha-numeric (including letters, numbers, upper-and-lower-case, etc) helps too.<br>
If you are going to use normal words it is a good idea to join together two normal words that don't normally go together.</p>
<h1>6. Protect your &quot;define pages&quot; content in &quot;html_includes&quot; </h1>
<p>After you have finished editing your <strong>define pages</strong> (Admin-&gt;Tools-&gt;Define Pages Editor), you should protect them:</p>
<p> A. Download a copy of them to your PC using your FTP software.  They are located in the <span class="filename">/includes/languages/english/html_includes</span> area.</p>
<p>B. Make them CHMOD 644 or 444 (or &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; for Windows hosts). See notes above on CHMOD. <br>
<span class="filename">/includes/languages/english/html_includes</span> &ndash; and all files/folders underneath<br>
<em>(note: on &quot;some&quot; hosts, you must use at least 645 or 555 in order for the contents to still display)</em> </p>
<p>If you make them read-only, then a would-be hacker cannot edit them if they gain access to your system, unless they can get permissions to change the read-only status, which is more complicated.<br />
<br />
<span class="error">NOTE: Of course, once you set them read-only, then you'll have to go and set them read-write before making additional changes using the define-pages editor. </span></p>
<h1>7. Use .htaccess files to protect against unwanted snooping </h1>
<p>In several folders, there are<span class="filename"> .htaccess </span>files to prevent users from being able to browse through the files on your site unless they know exact filenames. Some also prevent access to &quot;any&quot; .PHP scripts, since it's expected that all PHP files in those folders will be accessed by other PHP files, and not by a browser directly. This is good for security.<br />
If you delete these files, you run the risk of leaving yourself open to people snooping around.</p>
<p>There are also some semi-&quot;blank&quot; <span class="filename">index.html</span> files in several folders. These files are there to protect you in case your FTP software won't upload .htaccess files, or your server won't accept them. These only prevent directory browsing, and do not stop execution of .PHP files. It's a good &quot;alternative&quot;, although using <span class="filename">.htaccess</span> files in ALL of these folders is  the better choice, for servers that accept them.</p>
<p>Suggested content for <span class="filename">.htaccess</span> files in folders where there is an <span class="filename">index.html</span> file <span class="error">but NOT</span> yet an <span class="filename">.htaccess</span> file would be something like the following (depends on your server configuration):<br />
<div class="callout">
  <p><span class="filename">#.htaccess to prevent unauthorized directory browsing or access to .php files <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IndexIgnore */*<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Files *.php&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Deny,Allow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny from all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/Files&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  #add the following to protect against people finding your spiders.txt version   <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Files *.txt&gt;<br>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Deny,Allow    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny from all   <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Files&gt;</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>If your webhost configuration doesn't allow you to create/use your own <span class="filename">.htaccess</span> files, sometimes they provide an interface in your hosting admin control panel where you can set the desired <span class="filename">.htaccess</span> settings. </p>
<p>It is recommended that you work with your host to configure these settings if this is the method they require. <span class="error">You need to choose -- and use -- the appropriate method for your server.</span> As mentioned above, it's best to work with your web hosting company to select and implement the best method for your specific server. We can't tell you what to use for your specific server, but we offer these guidelines as a starting point.</p>
<h1>Disable &quot;Allow Guest To Tell A Friend&quot; feature </h1>
You may wish to go to Admin-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Email Options-&gt;Allow Guest To Tell A Friend and set the option to 'false'. This will prevent non-logged-in customers from using your server to send unwanted email messages. <br />
<h1>Protect your &quot;images&quot; and other folders </h1>
During initial installation, you are advised to set your images folder to read/write, so that you can use the Admin interface to upload product/category images without having to use FTP for each one. Similar recommendations are made to other files for various reasons. <br>
<br>
However, leaving the images (or any other) folder in read/write mode means that hackers might be able to put malicious files in this (or other) folder(s) and thus create access points from which to attempt nasty exploits. <br>
<br>
Thus, once your site is built and your images have been created/loaded, you should drop the security down from read/write to read. ie: change from CHMOD 777 down to 644 for files, and to 755 for folders. <br>
<br>
<h4>File/Folder permissions settings</h4>
<p>On Linux/Unix hosts, generally, permission-setting recommendations for basic security are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>folders/directories:   755 </li>
  <li>files:  644 </li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows hosts, setting files read-only is usually sufficient. Should double-check that the <em>Internet Guest Account</em> has limited (read-only) access. </p>
<h4>Folder Purposes</h4>
<p>The folders for which installation suggests read-write access for  setup are these. If your site supports .htaccess protection, then you  should use it for these folders. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="filename">/cache</span><br>
    This is used to cache session and database  information. The BEST security protection for this is to move it to a  folder "above" the webroot (public_html or htdocs or www) area, so that it's not  accessible via a browser. (Requires changes to DIR_FS_SQL_CACHE setting  in configure.php files as well as Admin &gt; Configuration &gt; Sessions &gt; Session Directory.)</li>
  <li><span class="filename">/images</span><br>
    See other suggestions earlier. </li>
  <li><span class="filename">/includes/languages/english/html_includes</span><br>
    See other suggestions earlier. </li>
  <li><span class="filename">/media</span><br>
    This is only suggested read-write for the sake of  being able to upload music-product media files via the admin. Could be  done by FTP as an alternative. </li>
  <li><span class="filename">/pub</span><br>
    This is used on Linux/Unix hosts to have downloadable  products made available to customers via a secure delivery method which  doesn't disclose the 'real' location of files/data on your server (so  that people can't share a URL and have their friends steal downloads  from your site) </li>
  <li><span class="filename">/admin/backups</span><br>
    This is used by automated backup routines to store database backups. Optional. </li>
  <li><span class="filename">/admin/images/graphs</span><br>
    This is used by the Admin &gt; Tools &gt; Banner Manager for updating/displaying bar graphs related to banner usage. If not writable, feature is ignored. <br />
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Remove the print URL from your browser's headers </h1>
<p>To stop the browser from printing a URL on the invoice or any other document on the web, follow these steps:</p>
<p> For Internet Explorer:<br>
o Click on File then Page Setup <br>
o At page setup, remove this two character combination: &quot;&amp;u&quot; from the header or footer text box. </p>
<p>For Firefox:<br>
o Click on <em>File</em> then <em>Page Setup<br>
o </em>On page setup window click on the tab "Margins &amp;  Header/Footer". In the "Header &amp; Footer" section set all of the  drop downs to --blank--. (Or at least remove all references to &quot;Title&quot; and &quot;URL&quot;.)</p>
<h1>Things to Check Up on Regularly</h1>
<ol><li>Be sure you've done all the steps listed in this document
<li>Keep good backups of your website files and database
<li>Check your server's errorlog regularly for odd or suspicious activity<ul>
<li>look for any links that went to a page that isn't in your site
<li>look for links that have http after the index.php </li></ul>
<li>Check your website files regularly to be sure nothing's been added or altered
<li>Ask your webhost what they have done to be sure the server you're on is safe and secure so that outsiders cannot do any harm, and so that other websites on your server cannot be used to get to your site and cause any harm (in case they have security holes in them)
<li>If your business warrants, or you still want additional assurance (esp if running forum software on your site, or other scripts outside of Zen Cart), hire a security consultant to check your site regularly and give you peace of mind in exchange for a few dollars </li>
