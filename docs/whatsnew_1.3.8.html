<h1>UPGRADING YOUR TEMPLATES </h1>
Since version 1.2, Zen Cart&trade; has had a major overhaul of the templating system for v1.3.  As such, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>
upgrade your existing template by applying the new stylesheet and moving a few lines of code around; or</li>
<li><strong>the best way </strong>to have almost-tableless and much tidier template code, is to <strong>make a new template</strong> (based on template_default or the new &quot;green&quot; classic introduced in v1.3.5) and carefully re-apply your own customizations to the new template system.</li>
</ul>


<p>For further information on template upgrading, see the support-forum discussion on this topic. </p>
